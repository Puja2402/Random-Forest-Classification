# Random-Forest-Classification
Decision tree concept is more to the rule based system. Given the training dataset with targets and features, the decision tree algorithm will come up with some set of rules. The same set rules can be used to perform the prediction on the test dataset.
Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.
